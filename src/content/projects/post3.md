BidAssist is a real-time auction platform, developed as a final project of the **Backend Developer** course at Fusalmo. Working as a team with three other people, **we had a week to plan, develop, test, document and deploy the application.** This project, designed to demonstrate the knowledge acquired in more than 140 hours of training, was presented to programmers with extensive experience and **won first place for best project.**

Technologies Used: The platform was built using **Node.js, Express, Redis, and MongoDB for the backend,** along with **Angular and MaterializeCSS for the frontend.** Additionally, we use **JWT** for user session management, ensuring secure and efficient authentication.

Featured Features: BidAssist allows users to place bids in real time, with an intuitive user interface and instant updates thanks to **WebSockets** integration.
