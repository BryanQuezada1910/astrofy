**WOW TV** is a web application developed for [WOW TV](https://www.facebook.com/wowtvsv), a news company that broadcasts live content. The platform is designed to efficiently manage news, allowing administrators to easily organize and publish content. It leverages **Astro Framework** on the frontend and **Strapi** on the backend for dynamic news management, with storage in **PostgreSQL** and **Cloudinary** to handle images and other media assets.

In addition to news management, the homepage features a live stream of the **WOW TV** channel, giving users direct access to the latest news and shows in real-time.
